I want to know the codes in SQL to show the vendor-specific pricing trends. Group data by vendor and compare average prices across vendors for each fruit type. Our group wants to focus on only the category of apples.

To filter the results to only include products with product_name containing "Apple", you can add a condition in the price_extracted CTE. Hereâ€™s the updated SQL code:

sql
Copy code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS avg_price_by_vendor;

CREATE TABLE avg_price_by_vendor AS
WITH price_extracted AS (
    SELECT 
        vendor,
        product_name,
        CAST(SUBSTR(units, INSTR(units, '$') + 1, INSTR(units, ' ') - INSTR(units, '$') - 1) AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) AS price_per_item
    FROM product
    WHERE units LIKE '%$%' -- Only select rows with a price in the format
      AND CAST(SUBSTR(units, INSTR(units, '$') + 1, INSTR(units, ' ') - INSTR(units, '$') - 1) AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) > 0 -- Exclude rows with price 0
      AND product_name LIKE '%Apple%' -- Filter only products with "Apple" in the name
), avg_price_per_vendor AS (
    SELECT 
        vendor,
        product_name,
        AVG(price_per_item) AS avg_price
    FROM price_extracted
    WHERE price_per_item IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY vendor, product_name
)
SELECT 
    vendor,
    product_name,
    avg_price
FROM avg_price_per_vendor;
Explanation
The condition AND product_name LIKE '%Apple%' in the price_extracted CTE filters the dataset to include only products with "Apple" in their product_name.
This ensures that only "Apple" products with a non-zero price are included in the final avg_price_by_vendor table.
This query will create the avg_price_by_vendor table with only non-zero priced Apple products. Let me know if you need additional adjustments!
